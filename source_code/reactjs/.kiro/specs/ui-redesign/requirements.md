# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves redesigning the Myanmar Font Preview application's user interface to improve usability and organization. The new design will separate controls from content with a two-panel layout: a collapsible left panel for all controls and settings, and a right panel dedicated to font previews with search functionality and flexible display options.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want all font controls organized in a left panel, so that I can easily access and manage all settings in one dedicated area.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL display a left panel containing all font controls
2. WHEN the user interacts with controls in the left panel THEN the system SHALL update the font previews in real-time
3. IF the left panel contains controls THEN the system SHALL include textarea for preview text, font size control, line height control, and show grid toggle
4. WHEN controls are modified THEN the system SHALL persist user preferences in local storage

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to collapse and expand the left control panel, so that I can maximize screen space for font previews when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks the collapse toggle THEN the system SHALL hide the left panel content while maintaining a minimal toggle button
2. WHEN the left panel is collapsed THEN the system SHALL expand the right panel to use the full available width
3. WHEN the user clicks the expand toggle THEN the system SHALL restore the left panel to its full width
4. WHEN the panel state changes THEN the system SHALL save the collapsed/expanded preference

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want a search box at the top of the right panel, so that I can quickly find specific fonts without scrolling through all categories.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL display a search box at the top of the right panel
2. WHEN the user types in the search box THEN the system SHALL filter font previews in real-time
3. WHEN search results are displayed THEN the system SHALL highlight matching font names
4. WHEN the search box is cleared THEN the system SHALL display all fonts organized by category

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to toggle between grid and list view for font previews, so that I can choose the display format that works best for my workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the grid toggle is enabled THEN the system SHALL display font previews in a responsive grid layout
2. WHEN the grid toggle is disabled THEN the system SHALL display font previews in a vertical list layout
3. WHEN the view mode changes THEN the system SHALL maintain the current search and filter state
4. WHEN the view preference is changed THEN the system SHALL save the setting for future sessions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the right panel to show font preview boxes based on my selected view mode, so that I can see fonts in my preferred layout while maintaining all functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN fonts are displayed THEN the system SHALL show preview boxes with sample text using each font
2. WHEN in grid mode THEN the system SHALL arrange preview boxes in a responsive grid with consistent sizing
3. WHEN in list mode THEN the system SHALL arrange preview boxes vertically with full width
4. WHEN preview text is updated in the left panel THEN the system SHALL update all preview boxes simultaneously
5. WHEN font size or line height is adjusted THEN the system SHALL apply changes to all preview boxes
